Having a system that allows more than one CAS provider would allow additional organizations to share the services. This may be interesting when extending the service to new customers and organizations. In fact, allowing other identity providers than CAS would allow a greater span of users to connect to the service. For instance, \github{} or \facebook{} could be used to identify standalone users who too would like to use the system.

%Having more ways of logging into the system, eg.\ \github{} or \facebook{}, would allow a greater number of people to access and try out the system. More users would also require finding a solution for scaling up the infrastructure to handle higher traffic.
