A feature that is not currently supported is the option for users to upload files to the platform. This limits the teachers' abilities to upload backgrounds for the map and requires all students to write their code using the site's in-browser editor. The Ace-editor we are currently using is limited both in terms of features and customizability. Further, this would allow the student to write and save their code offline in the case that either the site is down or if they are in a location with no network connection.

Implementing this feature could require support on both the frontend and backend. If the file is stored as a file in the database, support for storing files would be required. But the code could also be stored as a string similar to how code submissions through the in-browser editor are stored, which would only require some parsing on the frontend side.
