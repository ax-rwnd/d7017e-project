The way that the manager for Tester starts more containers for popular languages could be improved. The current solution indirectly bases the number of containers allocated to each language on the recent demand for that language. Instead of just adapting to load, the manager could use a model that predicts future load. This model could use more information than just the languages used in recent requests, such as which courses are currently given.
