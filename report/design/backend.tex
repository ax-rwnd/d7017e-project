The backend of GPP was developed using javascript running with NodeJs as server framework and Express as a webframework to handle routing. NodeJs was chosen because
it was the most established framework with wide support and multiple extensions, such as Express.
The document database MongoDB was chosen for the project instead of using a relational database, the reasoning for this decision was to have a database that was built with scalability in mind but also because of the simple reason that it is easy for the programmers to read and understand the data inside the database thanks to MongoDBs JSON-like document structure.
