% A coding-standard was quickly decided on to make sure the code style was somewhat coherent effectively making it easier for different members to take over other members code if needed.

The backend of GPP was developed using javascript running with NodeJs as server framework and Express as a webframework to handle routing. NodeJs was chosen because it was the most established framework with wide support and multiple extensions, such as Express.

\subsection{Database}
% choice of DB
% mongoose
% explain, motivate and evaluate schema design

% fixme
The document database MongoDB was chosen for the project instead of using a relational database, the reasoning for this decision was to have a database that was built with scalability in mind and dynamic schemas but also because of the simple reason that it is easy for the programmers to read and understand the data inside the database thanks to MongoDBs JSON-like document structure.

\subsection{API}
% endpoint names
% protocol, some input data in route, some in url, most of it in req body
% errors
% extensibility in features/progress/gamification

\subsection{Security}
% login/tokens
% input validation
% access control
% SSL (HTTPS), just mention it

\subsection{Quality control}
% jenkins
As a way to keep the project effective it was determined that it was important to implement continuous integration as a part of the project to have a modern workflow where you could push changes to git and have them automatically built on a live test server. Using continuous integration was also a good way to separate production and development builds and a way to ensure that production builds always kept a certain standard and robustness. The framework that was used for continuous integration was Jenkins which is one of the most popular frameworks.

While the idea of how continuous integration was supposed to be used in the project was quite clear, the concept wasn't put to as good use as it could have. In the first half of the project, the builds generated from Jenkins wasn't really put to use. This was mainly due to communication errors and the fact that the builds weren't needed as much. For the second part of the project the builds were used more. The way that the deployment with Jenkins was setup was to build from two branches from GIT, one from the master which was supposed to build for production and another from the backend branch which was supposed to build for development. The idea was that the development build would always contain the latest changes in backend. As the project reached its deadline it became increasingly important to also keep the backend dev builds stable because of the fact that the frontend team were depending on the backend dev build when developing.

Because of the increasing demands on having stable backend dev builds, a new requirement was setup for the continuous integration where a new development dev build was only built if it passed a set of unit-tests for the application.

% different environments
Connected to the reasoning of building the backend in different environments/modes such as production or development, it was important to load different configurations depending on what environment the backend was supposed to run. For example, the production environment should not use the same database as the development environment. Because of this, it was important to be able to run the backend in different modes and dynamically load the correct configurations based on the mode that the backend was running in, hence a system that did this was implemented.

% logging
A large part of developers and support teams work is monitoring, debugging and troubleshooting. Because of this it is important to have good logging as a way to make these processes easier, faster and smoother. Having good logging gives them a good insight into what the application is doing and how it works. Because of this, it was important to have proper, useful and extensible logging available in the backend. A custom logging system promtly named logger was developed that ran with Winston and Morgan at its core. Winston is a simple and universal logging library and Morgan is a HTTP request logger middleware. Logger combined winston and morgan with the selectiveness of running the backend in different modes/environments. Depending on the mode, logger had different parts that it logged into log files.

Logger was setup to log all errors, server errors and a general logs in separate log files. When running in dev mode it was also important to log to the console, but not otherwise, hence console logging was only enabled when the backend ran in dev mode. 

Winston and Logger use levels to identify what type of information a log contains, the logging levels in logger conform closely to the severity ordering specified by RFC6424.
The severity of all levels are numerically ascending from most important to least important.

\begin{enumerate}
  \item Server Error
  \item Error
  \item Warning
  \item Info
  \item Verbose
  \item Debug
  \item Silly
\end{enumerate}
