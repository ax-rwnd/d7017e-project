% intro, what is Tester trying to do?
% we want broad language support
Tester is a tool for testing code in a variety of different programming languages in a safe and isolated enviroment. To fulfill the needs of the GPP, Tester needs to support a  broad list of languages, so that the range of courses that can find use in the platform is not limited. Tester also strives for the functionality to test code based on different merits to further support the addition of various gamification elements to the GPP.

\subsection{Sandboxing}
\subsection{Manager}
% TODO: add discussion of different ways of managing load and what we chose
% (Start containers on demand? Keep a pool of containers ready? Predict load or just react? Allocate different amounts of resources for different languages?)
\subsection{Test types}
% unit tests are hard to write
% I/O tests are language-independent which is good if we want broad language support

\subsection{Extensibility}
In order to achieve broad language support, it needs to be easy to add new languages. Two steps are necessary to add support for a new language:

\begin{itemize}
\item The manager has a makefile that produces docker images for each supported language. The makefile needs to be extended with a new target that installs language-specific dependencies.

\item The Node instance running in the container needs to have a module for each supported language. Each language module exports two functions: \texttt{prepare}, which produces a file that can be run with the \texttt{run} function. The \texttt{prepare} step is useful for compiled languages, where a binary must be produced before running the program. Some languages, such as python, are run directly in the interpreter. By making preparation a separate step, the program does not need to be recompiled for each test.
\end{itemize}
