To meet the requirements and goals of the project it was clear that a platform that could compile and verify code was needed.
An initial suggestion from the project description was \techio{} which is a collaborative platform to share coding assignments through open-source ``playgrounds''. The platform seemed to match the needs of the project, but it was unsure if the platform would have an open API that could be connected with the platform later developed. It was found that \techio{} doesn't have any open API only possibility of using ``code snippets'' to embed coding assignments onto other sites than on \techio{}.
Because of no possibility to include \techio{} into the platform, \techio{} was discarded.\\
Another possibility for the code verification was \sockr{}, a application developed by a student at \LTU{}. \sockr{] didn't have any documentation and it was difficult to undarstand how it works so \sockr{} was also discarded as a possible application that could be used in the Gamified Programming Platform.
