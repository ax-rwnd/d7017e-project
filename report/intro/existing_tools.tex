To meet the requirements and goals of the project it was clear that a platform that could compile and run code was needed. An initial suggestion from the project description was that \techio{}, which is a collaborative platform to share coding assignments through open-source ``playgrounds'', could be used. The platform seemed to match the needs of the project and the project owner had been in touch with the developers, but no API access had been guaranteed. 

After some investigation into the platform and discussion with the developers, it was found that \techio{} does not have- and will not get any open APIs. Thus, the only possibility of using their system was to  embed ``code snippets'' from their site into the site that was to be built. Because of this shortcoming, \techio{} was discarded.

Another possibility for the code verification was to use \sockr{}, an application developed by a student at \LTU{} for hosting programming ladders. However, while the solution was more interesting from the licensing point of view, \sockr{} didn't have any documentation and required too much refactoring to be of use for the project.
