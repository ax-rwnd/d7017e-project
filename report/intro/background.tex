At \LTU\ there are many courses where programming takes a significant role. Students sometimes face difficulties in knowing whether they have solved an assignment correctly until a lab supervisor checks the code. This dependency on human interaction in general leads to a long feedback loop, as well as taking up too much of the lab supervisors time which could instead be used to help more students. 

The feedback loop can be drastically shortened with the help of automated testing. Such a tool could lead to less load on the lab supervisors, potential cost savings and more efficient time usage for students and teachers.

A way to make assignments more fun was to apply gamification to the requested web tool. The purpose of gamification is to take elements from games and apply them in other areas to create an increased commitment within the applied area. The target group for the platform was mainly students of Computer Science and Electrical and Space Engineering with a programming direction.

Other educations within LTU that could contain programming parts were also interesting and kept in mind, for example education for teachers where programming will become a central part in the future because of a revised curriculum that passed in the fall of 2017 for elementary school and high school.

To reach the goal of the project - which was to develop an interactive web tool for coding practice that shortened the feedback time and increased the fun of making assignments, a platform that embodied these ideas was needed. The goal was to have a platform that was easy for both users and teachers alike. Gamification was a big part of the platform, but it became apparent that not all teachers wanted to use these elements and because of this it was important that the gamification features were optional and that it was easy to enable and disable the features for each course as the teacher saw fit. Because of this, a big part of the goal during development of the platform was to make features modular and simple.

The expected result of the project was closely connected with the goal of the project. The platform needed to include gamification elements that stimulate and inspire the  students so that they would want to program more and become better at programming. Further it was important that students should be able to write the code inside their web browser and be able to instantly verify if they have passed the requirements for the assignment or not, effectively shortening the feedback time.

To further motivate the students and make them feel that programming is fun, the platform needed to support progress and different levels of difficulty so that every student can feel properly challenged. In the more classic educational model, practical programming tasks would usually only amount to a few assignments with large increases in difficulty, where some students would feel overwhelmed by the difficulty of the assignments and other students would be underwhelmed by the reward provided by solving said assignments
By offering smaller increments in difficulty, it would be easier to keep students from getting stuck at specific tasks, even if the task is considerably harder than the first task the student did. With different difficulties, every student could feel that they received challenges and rewards that correctly represented their level of knowledge.
Finally the platform shouldn't be limited to LTU even though LTU students are the primary users of the platform.
