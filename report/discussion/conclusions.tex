Gamification has become a large part of motivation. By getting rewards for performed works the motivation and satisfaction increases. Gamification with immediate feedback in programming is fairly new since learning programming has grown and spread to lower ages, a tool for learning programming quickly is needed.  
The platform provided is dynamic in that way that there is no limitation in the difficulty in the assignments, the creator of the assignment is that one which sets the level. By that said, even since the target is university students, the platform is also applicable to younger students. There are endless choices for new gamification parts that can be implemented, only the imagination puts a stop to which parts can be implemented. The platform delivered is an initial working product that is usable but can be expanded to fairly low cost.
