First off, there were 15 students in a project that was dimensioned for 7--9 students. Apart from the common issues that arise when managing very large groups, the oversized project group made members who aren't as used to voicing their opinions express themselves even less. Ironically, this is a characteristic that was discussed in the conducted interviews and the solution is usually to either help people trust one another (teambuilding), or to remove the requirement of trust (anonymization). 

Another issue was that the project specification didn't specify enough details regarding the requested product. This lead to a long prestudy wherein a lot of time was devoted to answering questions that probably could have been answered by the project owner or at least outside of the project deadline by a smaller group. To make matters worse, no work could be initiated until the prestudy was done, lest you'd want to run the risk of performing work that would be thrown away once the project goal changed. In effect, a lot of people did very little work during the four first weeks, and there was very little that could have been done about it on our part.

Delegating all inter-group communication to the leaders did not work well, probably because the needs were far too large. Most of the communication between groups happened in the project-room between developers. Another consequence of this is that developers that did not work from the project-room had trouble staying updated on the latest decisions and reporting their progress. This made it difficult to keep the developers saturated with tasks.

The project leader, who was supposed to lead the work, did not appear sufficiently in the project room to have good insight into the current development. This lead to a lack of technical depth in the presentations. To increase the technical content of the presentations, the responsibility was gradually shifted to the group leaders. In conclusion, there were too many levels of leaders for an organization of this size.

The agile development style was well-suited to the biweekly presentations. The group was not completely satisfied with \taiga{} as a sprint planning tool. There were many features that were not used because they seemed to only increase the burden on the developers. The group leaders found that transitioning between sprints required a lot of manual work. Partly as a result of the problems with the tool, tasks gradually transitioned to being tracked on a whiteboard in the project-room. This lead to a clearer picture of the current tasks for on-site developers, but compounded the previously mentioned problems for remote developers.
