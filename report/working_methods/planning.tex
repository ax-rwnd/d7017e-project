Agile work flow was used during the project. This was done by dividing the weeks into sprints. A sprint was expected to be one week but sometimes sprints become longer due to heavy workload. Every sprint was planned before the current sprint was ended. The group leaders planned the sprints, one from each current sub group along with the project leader. \taiga{}, a sprint planning tool kept track of the backlog and different task assigned to individual group members. This showed which task was completed and which needed to be helped with.
