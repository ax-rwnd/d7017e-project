To plan the project, an agile workflow was adopted, this meant dividing the work into sprints, where the end of each sprint represented a project presentation. In each presentation, some progress that was not in the solution the week prior was presented, which became the implicit milestones of the project.

Sprint planning was done using the \taiga{} taskboard. By using a web-based tool, most planning could be done remotely instead of on a physical taskboard. Furthermore, participants didn't need to visit the project-room to see- or update their tasks, instead they could edit the tasks remotely from their own computers.
