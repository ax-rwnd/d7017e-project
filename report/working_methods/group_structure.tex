All of the main task during the project were split into groups. During the project it was laborated on how many number of groups would be the most efficient for the project. The working model that was found was to have three groups with 4-5 members each as long as there were enough tasks in different sections for three groups. Once time in a week all members met and discussed the previous week and the upcoming week. This became a meeting with 15 people that ended up talking over each other which felt ineffective. This was solved by minimizing the meeting members to three-four people: the project leader along with one group leader each from the main groups. The leaders were democratically chosen in each active group and their task was to share with the other group leaders what they have done during previous period and what will they accomplish during next period. The groups leaders represented the groups and had as responibillity to share the discussions from the meetings to their groups.
